   - Strict password complexity requirements
   - Password history maintenance
   - Brute force protection

2. **Email Verification**
   - Two-way email verification
   - Secure token generation
   - Limited-time validity
   - Rate-limited verification attempts

3. **Phone Verification**
   - SMS-based verification codes
   - Region-specific phone validation
   - Carrier validation
   - Rate-limited SMS sending

4. **Security Questions**
   - Customizable security questions
   - Case-insensitive answer validation
   - Multiple question rotation
   - Answer encryption

5. **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)**
   - RFC 6238 compliant
   - 30-second rotation
   - Secure key generation
   - Multiple device support

### 2. Session Security
